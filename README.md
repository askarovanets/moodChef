**The idea**

The idea for this final project came to me while I was eating ramen. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to do much, so, as usual, I grabbed some ramen and went home. However, I noticed that eating ramen always worsened my skin, causing acne and scars. I realized that I am not alone, many people eat out of stress and they eat not the good food. They eat processed food that lacks nutrition, and that‚Äôs what inspired me to create an app to help with this issue. Initially, the concept was to make an app specifically for people feeling down, but that seemed a bit sad. "An App for Sad!" sounds not good, right? So, I turned it into a mood-based app instead. Now, people (or myself) who feel sad can avoid eating something unhealthy like ramen and instead prepare a meal from ingredients they already have. Combining these two APIs turned out to be the right choice, in my opinion.

Despite wanting to add log-in system, I found it pointless as sad people won't go through all the process just to check what the app is about. Me too, often delete the programs that don't show functionality right away and rather ask to register.
Adding "like/favorite" system was also one of my ideas but that would bias program into showing you more recipes you already tried, and not something new, so I decided not to do it as well. 

I also wanted to include a mood-tracking feature, but due to my lack of skills, I couldn‚Äôt implement it this time. 
However, I might add it in the future! /maybe/
